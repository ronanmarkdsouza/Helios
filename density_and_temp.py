Description:
        This function takes in the altitude (m) of the rocket at a given time interval and the temperature (K) of the outside at sea level 
        to compute density and temperature at every given time step respectively.  

Function Inputes:
        y --> Altitude of the rocket at a given time step in meters
        t1 --> Temperature of the outside at sea level in kelvin

Function Outputs:
        d --> Density of the air at a given altitude
        t --> Temperature of the air at a given altitude
